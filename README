install-clang
=============

This is a script that installs independent standalone versions of
clang[1], LLVM[2], libc++[3], and compiler-rt[4], on Darwin and Linux.
It links clang itself against libc++ and contains all of the
installation within a given installation prefix (e.g., /opt/llvm),
making it straight-forward to keep it separate from any already
installed compiler and libraries.

Usage:

    ./install-clang --install <prefix>

Once finished, just puth "<prefix>/bin" into your PATH.

The script supports Linux and MacOS, and will install the 3.2 branches
of the relevant llvm.org projects (versions can be changed). It
downloads all the sources directly from their corresponding master git
repositories, and compiles the pieces as needed.

Doing a standalone installation is a bit messier than one would hope,
and the scripts captures some trial-and-error I went through to get it
working. Specifically:

    - It compiles clang/LLVM twice, once to boostrap with the system
      compiler and then with itself.

    - It uses (and installs) libabi++[5] on Darwin but pathscale's
      libcxxrt[6] on Linux.

    - It patches clang to search libc++ headers relative to the
      installation prefix.

    - It patches the build scripts for libc++ and libc++abi to accept
      prefix specification and fix some other stuff.

I welcome any suggestions on making this process simpler. As I figured
some of this out with older versions, there might be some parts to the
setup that aren't necessary anymore. Maybe I'm also just missing the
more straight-forward way somewhere.

Note: the script also has an --update option that's supposed to catch
up to upstream repository changes without doing the complete 2-stage
compile/install again. However, that option hasn't been tried much
recently and might be broken. By default, it also has no effect right
now sicne the git versions to use are hardcoded. To try --update,
change the versions found at the beginning of the script to "master".
