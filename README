install-clang
=============

This script installs self-contained standalone versions of clang[1],
LLVM[2], libc++[3], and compiler-rt[4], on Darwin and Linux, including
linking clang and LLVM themselves against libc++ as well. The script
keeps all of the installation within a given target prefix (e.g.,
/opt/llvm), and hence separate from any already installed compilers,
libraries, and include files. In particular, you can later deinstall
everything easily by just deleting, e.g., /opt/llvm. Furthermore, as
long as the prefix path is writable, the installation doesn't need
root privileges.

Usage:

    ./install-clang --install <prefix>

Once finished, just prefix your PATH with "<prefix>/bin" and you're
ready to use the new binaries.

By default, install-clang currently installs the 3.2 branches of the
relevant llvm.org projects; the versions can be changed by editing the
definitions at the beginning of the script. The installation process
downloads all the sources directly from their corresponding master git
repositories and then compiles the pieces as needed. Other OSs than
Darwin and Linux are not currently supported.

Doing a self-contained clang/LLVM installation is a bit more messy
than one would hope because the projects make assumptions about
specific system-wide installation paths to use. The install-clang
script captures some trial-and-error I went through to get an
independent setup working. Specifically:

    - It compiles clang/LLVM twice, once to boostrap with the system
      compiler and then again with itself linking against the new
      libraries.

    - It uses libabi++[5] on Darwin but pathscale's libcxxrt[6] on
      Linux.

    - It patches clang to search libc++ headers relative to the
      installation prefix.

    - It patches the build scripts for libc++ and libc++abi to accept
      prefix specification and fix some other stuff.

I welcome any suggestions on making this process simpler. As I
originally figured some of this out with older versions, there might
be some parts of the process that aren't necessary anymore.
Furthermore, I may also just be missing a more straight-forward way
somewhere.

Note: the script also has an --update option that's allows to catch up
with upstream repository changes without doing the complete 2-stage
compile/install cycle again. However, that option hasn't been tried
much recently and might be broken. By default it also has no immediate
effect since the git versions to use are hardcoded to the LLVM/clang
3.2 branches. If you want to try --update, change the versions at the
beginning of the script to "master" (but again, update mode may just
be broken right now).
